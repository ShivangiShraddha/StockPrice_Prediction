# 📈 Stock Price (Profit) Prediction using Linear Regression

This project demonstrates a machine learning-based prediction model built using Python and Scikit-learn to predict company profit based on key business expenditures. The model is implemented using Google Colab.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

The objective of this project is to predict company profit using the following independent variables:
- R&D Spend  
- Administration  
- Marketing Spend  

A Multiple Linear Regression model is used to understand the relationship between these factors and profit.
